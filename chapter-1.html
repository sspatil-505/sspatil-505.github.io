            <p>My father’s office is where the memory really begins. It wasn't a dark and stormy night, but the air felt
                heavy with the specific weight of something about to change.</p>

            <p>I remember the small details most vividly, the way the light fell across my dad’s office, with its large
                adjustable drafting desk angled for drawing designs, the smell of rain on dry earth, and the feeling
                that something was about to go wrong. This was around 2005, before computers became common in India for
                building design, when scales and pencils ruled the workspace.</p>

            <p>I was in my dad’s office, using his adjustable design desk as my very own canvas for drawing. My mother
                wanted to go to the post office to send Rakhis to my cousins and her brother, my uncle. She asked if I
                wanted to join her and my sister, but I was having so much fun with my drawings, and being the daddy’s
                girl
                that I was, I decided to stay back. The office itself had once belonged to Manohar Parrikar’s brother,
                and my dad later rented it and made significant changes to suit his work.</p>

            <p> I didn’t know then that boredom would strike so quickly. Soon, someone came to visit my dad, and I got
                restless immediately. I yelled at him, insisting I wanted to go with mom, but by the time I ran out, she
                had
                already gone a little too far.</p>
            <p> This was on SPM Road in Belgaum, near the Kapileshwar temple. She had crossed the road. It had started
                to drizzle, and because of the traffic, she couldn’t hear me calling out. I didn’t know how to cross the
                road by myself. I ran along the road, parallel to them, hoping they would notice me, but at one point, I
                lost sight of them completely.</p>
            <p> Panicking, I asked an old man to help me cross to the other side of the road. Once there, I still
                couldn’t find my mother or my sister. I stood there, unsure of what to do, unable to go forward and
                unable to go back to my dad’s office.</p>
            <p> Then I remembered my dad’s aunt’s house. I ran there, crying, telling them I was lost and that my mom
                had gone to the post office. They assumed my mother had dropped me off and that I was crying for some
                other reason. They were busy trying to give medicine to my sick second cousin. My uncle, my dad’s
                cousin, turned on Doraemon to distract me, and slowly, I stopped crying.</p>
            <p>Two or three hours later, my parents finally arrived. My mother hugged me and cried. Only later did I
                understand how scared she must have been</p>
            <p>Later that night, when I started crying again and said that I wouldn’t have known what to do if I hadn’t
                found them, my dad broke down too. He had tears in his eyes. It was the first time I had ever seen my
                dad cry.</p>
            <p>Over time, this incident turned into a story my parents and I now tell with a strange mix of laughter and
                disbelief. They later told me that the police uncle who lived near our house had also stepped out to
                look for me. My school auto-rickshaw uncle had even spotted me in the rain, though he didn’t realize I
                was lost, or perhaps assumed I was headed somewhere familiar. My parents had also called relatives,
                asking them to help search, including the very aunt whose house I had run to, only to be told that I was
                already there.</p>
            <p> At the time, I knew none of this. I was just a child trying to find her way. Only years later did I
                understand how many people were quietly looking out for me that rainy afternoon.</p>

            <div class="placeholder-text">
                Rakshabandhan, a Hindu festival celebrated in India, is a time when sisters tie a thread, called a
                rakhi,
                on their brother's arm as a symbol of protection. It celebrates the special bond between a brother and a
                sister. In return, the brother gives a gift to his sister and assures her that he will always protect
                her.
